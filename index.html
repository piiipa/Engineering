    My second week... <br> This week, I learned about mechanical engineering. I learned many things like what it was and what you could do in it. I learned that people make machines. I also learned how they draft and design it. My teacher went over safety slides and I had a quiz on it. My class also started a project where you put together simple machines to try and complete a task. It is called a Rube Goldberg Machine. I can only use cardboard and tape. The task is to use a baseball to pop a balloon with those simple machines. The teacher also taught us how to use TinkerCad, a website. We used the website to start making a model for our Rube Goldberg Machine.

    My third week... <br> This week, I had a challenge. The challenge was to get an object from my home and remake it using TinkerCAD. It was a competition, and whoever made the most detailed looking object won. I decided to make a game console. I used different shapes and colors to try and make my object as detailed as possible. After the challenge, I continued to work on my Rube Goldberg model. I tried improving it by using more accurate measurements. I added a few more details to make it easier to know what I was doing. I also had another challenge on friday, where I had to make an E using accurate measurements. I had to give that E to somebody else and they had to cut it out, and whoever had the most accurate E won.

    My fourth week... <br> THis week, I worked on my Rube Goldberg machine. I increased the size of it. I also started building it with cardboard. I drew pieces of the machines and cut it out. I used a lot of tape to connect and reinforce the pieces. I also had a challenge where I had to build a paper boat and see if it could float for 5 minutes with weights on it. I searched up a video on how to make a sturdy boat. I made it and added weights. It down in less than a second. I figured I used too many weights. I was disappointed.

    My fifth week... <br> This week, I continued to work on my Rube Goldberg machine. I used a lot of tape to reinforce and keep things sturdy. I also went to an assembly for the first time in highschool.
    The day after the assembly, I took the MAP test. I got a pretty good score. Today, I continued my Rube Goldberg machine. I added a few more things like a wall and upgraded the lever. 
    I then added the balloon and tested. It failed the first time, but the pin hit the balloon. So we tried again, and it worked.
