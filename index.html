    My second week... <br> This week, I learned about mechanical engineering. I learned many things like what it was and what you could do in it. I learned that people make machines. I also learned how they draft and design it. My teacher went over safety slides and I had a quiz on it. My class also started a project where you put together simple machines to try and complete a task. It is called a Rube Goldberg Machine. I can only use cardboard and tape. The task is to use a baseball to pop a balloon with those simple machines. The teacher also taught us how to use TinkerCad, a website. We used the website to start making a model for our Rube Goldberg Machine.

    My third week... <br> This week, I had a challenge. The challenge was to get an object from my home and remake it using TinkerCAD. It was a competition, and whoever made the most detailed looking object won. I decided to make a game console. I used different shapes and colors to try and make my object as detailed as possible. After the challenge, I continued to work on my Rube Goldberg model. I tried improving it by using more accurate measurements. I added a few more details to make it easier to know what I was doing. I also had another challenge on friday, where I had to make an E using accurate measurements. I had to give that E to somebody else and they had to cut it out, and whoever had the most accurate E won.

    My fourth week... <br> THis week, I worked on my Rube Goldberg machine. I increased the size of it. I also started building it with cardboard. I drew pieces of the machines and cut it out. I used a lot of tape to connect and reinforce the pieces. I also had a challenge where I had to build a paper boat and see if it could float for 5 minutes with weights on it. I searched up a video on how to make a sturdy boat. I made it and added weights. It down in less than a second. I figured I used too many weights. I was disappointed.

    My fifth week... <br> This week, I continued to work on my Rube Goldberg machine. I used a lot of tape to reinforce and keep things sturdy. I also went to an assembly for the first time in highschool.
    The day after the assembly, I took the MAP test. I got a pretty good score. Today, I continued my Rube Goldberg machine. I added a few more things like a wall and upgraded the lever. 
    I then added the balloon and tested. It failed the first time, but the pin hit the balloon. So we tried again, and it worked.

    My sixth week... <br> This week was fun but a little annoying. 
    On Monday, we were told that we would be disecting a labtop. We went over the activites we would do and the homework.
    On Wednesday, we got the labtops. I formed a group with 2 other people. 
    Together, we started disassembling the labtop. I had a screw driver with no handle, and that slowed down the process by a lot.
    I took out most of the components, and on Friday I continued. I completely disassembled the labtop and colored and labeled on a worksheet.
    Then I had to reassemble everything.

    My seventh week... <br> This week was kind of boring. 
    On Monday, we didn't really do much. On Wednesday, we researched animals 
    that we liked. The assignment was to find an animal that lost an important limb.
    We had to find what prosthetic they used to help the animal. We then had to find 
    what material was used to make it, how it was attached, and other things like that.
    We then went to TinkerCAD and made a model of the prosthetic limb.
    On Friday, we did an activity where we had write a step by step how to make a PB&J sandwich.
    We then had people go to the front and make a sandwich with those steps. It was pretty fun.

    My eighth week... <br> This week was interesting. The schedule was weird.
    On Monday, it was a normal 1,3,5 day. On Tuesday, it was a 2,4,6 day. 
    On Wednesday, I took the PSAT. It was boring, but it helped me understand
    what the PSAT would be like. Today, I did an activity where I built a paper airplane 
    and threw it to try and make it in a trash can. My plane got stuck in a tree. 
    Tomorrow, I think I am just going to work on my website. My photos still wont work, so I might fix that.

    My ninth week... <br> This week was fun. The schedule was weird again.
    We learned about rockets and how they worked. We made models for bottled rockets on TinkerCAD.
    We started working on building them. We used materials like cardboard and tape.
    We also used hot glue to stick things together. My design was a triangle sandwich with the bottle in the middle.
    When we tested it, it flipped twice and nose-dived the ground. It could have worked better if I angled it a little more down, 45 degree angle.
