    My first week... <br> I planned on how to do my Rube Goldberg machine. I also learned how to use TinkerCAD. I used it to make a design for the machine. I also did an activity with it where I had to build an object from my house. I decided to make a game console. I had to put detail into it and the most detailed object won a kit kat. I won the challenge. I made it with accurate measurements. I also continued to work on the Rube Goldberg machine by making the measurements more accurate. I added more details and polished it.
