    My second week... <br> This week, I learned about mechanical engineering. I learned many things like what it was and what you could do in it. I learned that people make machines. I also learned how they draft and design it. My teacher went over safety slides and I had a quiz on it. My class also started a project where you put together simple machines to try and complete a task. It is called a Rube Goldberg Machine. I can only use cardboard and tape. The task is to use a baseball to pop a balloon with those simple machines. The teacher also taught us how to use TinkerCad, a website. We used the website to start making a model for our Rube Goldberg Machine.
</i></p>
<p><i>
    My third week... <br> This week, I had a challenge. The challenge was to get an object from my home and remake it using TinkerCAD. It was a competition, and whoever made the most detailed looking object won. I decided to make a game console. I used different shapes and colors to try and make my object as detailed as possible. After the challenge, I continued to work on my Rube Goldberg model. I tried improving it by using more accurate measurements. I added a few more details to make it easier to know what I was doing. I also had another challenge on friday, where I had to make an E using accurate measurements. I had to give that E to somebody else and they had to cut it out, and whoever had the most accurate E won.
</i></p>
<p><i>
    My fourth week... <br> THis week, I worked on my Rube Goldberg machine. I increased the size of it. I also started building it with cardboard. I drew pieces of the machines and cut it out. I used a lot of tape to connect and reinforce the pieces. I also had a challenge where I had to build a paper boat and see if it could float for 5 minutes with weights on it. I searched up a video on how to make a sturdy boat. I made it and added weights. It down in less than a second. I figured I used too many weights. I was disappointed.
</i></p>
<p><i>
    My fifth week... <br> This week, I continued to work on my Rube Goldberg machine. I used a lot of tape to reinforce and keep things sturdy. I also went to an assembly for the first time in highschool.
    The day after the assembly, I took the MAP test. I got a pretty good score. Today, I continued my Rube Goldberg machine. I added a few more things like a wall and upgraded the lever. 
    I then added the balloon and tested. It failed the first time, but the pin hit the balloon. So we tried again, and it worked.

<p><i>
    My sixth week... <br> This week was fun but a little annoying. 
    On Monday, we were told that we would be disecting a labtop. We went over the activites we would do and the homework.
    On Wednesday, we got the labtops. I formed a group with 2 other people. 
    Together, we started disassembling the labtop. I had a screw driver with no handle, and that slowed down the process by a lot.
    I took out most of the components, and on Friday I continued. I completely disassembled the labtop and colored and labeled on a worksheet.
    Then I had to reassemble everything.
</i></p>
<p><i>
    My seventh week... <br> This week was kind of boring. 
    On Monday, we didn't really do much. On Wednesday, we researched animals 
    that we liked. The assignment was to find an animal that lost an important limb.
    We had to find what prosthetic they used to help the animal. We then had to find 
    what material was used to make it, how it was attached, and other things like that.
    We then went to TinkerCAD and made a model of the prosthetic limb.
    On Friday, we did an activity where we had write a step by step how to make a PB&J sandwich.
    We then had people go to the front and make a sandwich with those steps. It was pretty fun.
</i></p>
<p><i>
    My eighth week... <br> This week was interesting. The schedule was weird.
    On Monday, it was a normal 1,3,5 day. On Tuesday, it was a 2,4,6 day. 
    On Wednesday, I took the PSAT. It was boring, but it helped me understand
    what the PSAT would be like. Today, I did an activity where I built a paper airplane 
    and threw it to try and make it in a trash can. My plane got stuck in a tree. 
    Tomorrow, I think I am just going to work on my website. My photos still wont work, so I might fix that.
</i></p>
<p><i>
    My ninth week... <br> This week was fun. The schedule was weird again.
    We learned about rockets and how they worked. We made models for bottled rockets on TinkerCAD.
    We started working on building them. We used materials like cardboard and tape.
    We also used hot glue to stick things together. My design was a triangle sandwich with the bottle in the middle.
    When we tested it, it flipped twice and nose-dived the ground. It could have worked better if I angled it a little more down, 45 degree angle.
</i></p>
<p><i>
    My tenth week... <br> This week was interesting. The schedule was weird this week as well.
    We did a challenge with candycorn. We had to see how many candycorns would fit on a sheet of paper.
    My guess was near the 200s. We also learned about environmental engineering.
    We learned about things people made to help the environment. For example, we learned that people made water purifiers so that people without water would have something to drink.
    We also learned how to make a purifier. We had a challenge where he made one and see which group had the clearest water after the challenge.
</i></p>
<p><i>
    My eleventh week... <br> This week was fun. Our monday was a normal day again.
    This week, we learned about electrical engineering. We learned about circuit boards and other things in computers, etc.
    We went over slides talking about electrical engineering, and I think I learned a lot. After, we did a tinkerCAD on a "bread board."
    On the board, we connected wires, resistors. and led lights. Our goal was to try and make them light up. 
    We learned about different types like parallel and series circuits. I made both models and we are supposed to use the real bread boards next week.
</i></p>
<p><i>
    My twelfth week... <br> This week was also fun. This week's schedule was weird once again. 
    We started working with the bread boards. We messed around with them.
    We made parallel and series circuits, and used the multimeter to measure volts. We also got to make our own experiments.
    On thursday, I did a challenge on what I would rather do. The options were to sit in a math class for 50 minutes everyday for a school year, or count to a million.
    I chose to sit through the math class because it would take a shorter time. I wouldn't mind because I do it anyways.
</i></p>
<p><i>
    My thirteenth week... <br> This week was confusing. We messed around with bread boards again.
    We started using a new program called Arduino. We used it to code.
    We used the code to make our led lights shine. We then coded it to flicker.
    It was tough at first, but after a few tries, we got it to work. We then messed around with the code to find other things.
    We couldn't get it to do anything else. I learned how to use code to change the ways led lights worked.
    
    <p><i>
        My fourteenth week... <br> I was very tired this week. It was our first week back from our Winter Break.
        This week, we learned about business engineering. We learned about many different inventions people made that helps us in our every day lives.
        We did an activity that was similar to Shark Tank. Me and my friend came up with the idea of a "Foon."
        It was supposed to be a spork but better. Some people liked our idea, but one person shut it down with something they had.
        It was a fun week and I learned a lot about business engineering.
    </i></p>
    <p><i>
        My fifteenth week... <br> I was also tired this week. I had monday off because it was Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
        This week, we learned about chemical engineering. We learned that people that take this job are very helpful.
        They solve problems by using cheap and time efficient ways. For example, we did a problem statement where we had to find a way to stop a large lake from giving cancer.
        My groupmate and I came up with the idea of planting algae to block the sunlight. However, we later found that it would not work as well as we thought.
        There was a solution to this problem. It was a real life problem, and it was solved by a group of people. 
        They poured a bunch of small black balls in the pond. These balls floated on top of the lake, and blocked the sunlight, which stopped the lake from being hazardous.

        My Project <br> For my project, I decided to make a mousetrap car. This was my first time making a mousetrap car, so I had to research a lot.
        I had to find out how to make one, and how it worked. I found out that to make the mousetrap car move, I had to attach a stick to the mousetrap, a string to the stick, and tie it around a dowel to make the wheels spin. I struggled in making the stick attach to the mousetrap because the stick would always move when I tried to hot glue it. I managed to make it stick to the mousetrap by having another stick hold on the the mousetrap, and I attached the longer stick to the mousetrap much easier.
        At first, I tried to use a really long stick to try and make the car move further. However, I found that the stick being too long was too heavy for the car, so I had to shrink the stick so that the mousetrap could move easier. This worked a little better, so I decided to keep trying to find the perfect length for the car. I also noticed that because the dowel we were given was not straight, the car would always turn. 
        We could not really fix this because we had already glued it on to the base of the car, and we could not get another one. We also struggled when trying to get the tires on. There was a problem where the wheels would move around too much, so we had to glue it to the dowel with a piece of cardboard. This worked really well keeping the tires steady and helping the car move without the wheels falling off.

        My tenth week... <br> This week was fun. The objective of this week was to make a design to keep an egg from breaking after dropping it from 3 stories high.
        My groupmates and I made a design. We decided to put the egg in a hull made with popsicle sticks and held together with tape. We planned on attaching a bag on top to act as a parachute.
        We also decided to attach a ballon on top of the parachute to try and help make the egg fall slowly.
        We also used 3 straws and attached them to the popsicle sticks to try and have them absorb the impact of the fall. We thought about using cotton balls to also help keep the egg from breaking.
        We then tinkerCAD the drawing, and we got a lot of it done. Next week, we will build the project, and hopefully it would work well.
    </i></p>
    <p><i>
        My eleventh week... <br> This week's challenge was my favorite challenge. The challenge was an egg dropping challenge.
        We had to drop an egg from 3 stories high and try and keep it from cracking. It was very fun to try and think of different ways to keep the egg from cracking.
        My groupmates and I worked together to try and come yp with different designs. We decided on making a shell for the egg, and having a parachute to make it fall slower.
        We had straws at the bottom of the shell to try and absorb some of the impact. We also tied a ballon on top of the parachute to try and keep it steady.
        Our first attempt wasn't good because it ended up flying back, and landed somewhere that it wasn't supposed to land. When we tested it again, it worked well.

        My twelfth week... <br> This week, we were told that we were supposed to make a boat out of cardboard and duct tape. The challenge was to use the boat to get across a pool, and get back.
        My groupmates and I took turn sharing different designs, and we decided to go along with a diamond shaped boat. We also thought of making paddles with the cardboard so that we could get across the pool easier.
        I also started TinkerCADing. We made different shapes of the boat, made a net, and also made accurate measurements.
        We came up with an estimate of how much cardboard and duct tape we would need to make the boat. We also did a challenge where we had to make a bridge out of only sticky notes.
        I decided to go with a simple design and just stick the sticky notes along the edges to get as far as possible. In the end, we got to about 130 centimeters.

    <p><i>
        My thirteenth week... <br> This week, we started to cut out the pieces for our boat. We drew out the pieces that we needed. 
        I cut out two triangles for the bottom of our boat. We also cut out two walls for the triangle.
        We also drew out more pieces on the cardboard, and we plan on cutting them out. However, we realised that the pieces that we were given were too small.
        We decided to go around this issue by either cutting out two pieces and taping them together, or waiting to get a bigger piece. We also had to make a few changes to the tinkerCAD to fit our design.
        Next week, we plan on taping all the pieces together. I also plan on making some paddles to help move in the boat.
    </i></p>
        My fourteenth week... <br> This week, we continued to cut out pieces for our boat. We cut out more of the boat's walls.
        We also made a tiny prototype or the boat. We made it to try and see if it would hold a few bricks. This would help us to see if it would float and if it would work as a boat.
        We ended up taping some of the pieces together, and we also cut out the main base for our boat. 
        We are going to test our prototype soon, and if it works, we are going to see what else we can add to make it better. Next week, we plan on making a few paddles for our boat.
        This is so that we can move around more easily in our boat. We are also planning on making a sail, and hopefully it will help move the boat without us having to do anything.
    <p><i>
        my fifteenth week... <br> This week, we started taping some parts of our boat together. We taped the walls to our triangle pieces, and also started working on the base of the boat.
        We had to use whatever was available. We did not have enough tape to finish taping the entire boat, so we stopped when we ran out, and we started drawing out more pieces of our boat.
        We then cut out more pieces. Next week, we plan on taping all the pieces together.
        We also plan on cutting out more pieces to stick to the bottom of the boat. We will tape these pieces to the bottom when more tape becomes available.
        We also finished working on our paddles. They came out very nice, and we taped any holes that would end up having water inside them.
    </i></p></P>
    <p><i>
        My sixteenth week... <br> This week, we cut out some more pieces for the bottom of the boat. We plan on using these pieces to make the boat sturdy and be able to hold more weight.
        We also want to try and tape it so that it becomes a bit waterproof. We used the pieces we cut out, and finished building the base of the boat.
        We also attached more of the walls to the boat. Next week, we will probably tape the other pieces to the bottom of our boat to make it stronger.
        We might also add a few little details to our boat to make it look cool. If we have any left over tape, we will tape the entire bottom of the boat to keep it from flooding.
        We will also tape any holes or cracks we find so that water won't be able to come in. I think that we will finish this by the end of next week.
    </i></p>
    <p><i>
        My seventeenth week... <br> This week, we almost finished our boat. We decided that we would hold off on finishing everything for the boat, and start to decorate it to look cool.
        We went for a shark design. One of our group members drew the face of the shark in the front of our boat.
        The rest of us cut out fins for the back and top of our boat. I am very satisfied with how it turned out.
